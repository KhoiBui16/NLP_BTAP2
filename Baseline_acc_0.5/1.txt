 I saw an all red Audi on the highway. I sped uo to it hoping it was you. My loss
"	REALLY?? oh.. sorry yall  lol"
Widget is mostly useless - it constantly displays no items while having a list selected that is well populated. Alternately, the widget becomes logged out somehow. Hope this gets fixed.
Like the look but it messes up straight away. Instead of saving an entry the app cashed and deleted it instead. Don't get!!
ughh...i dont feel good
 I accidently dropped it & now the screen is all messed
No pomo time more than 1hr. No whitelist available. No feature for tracking task progress. Also add the feature to quit bad habits.

So wish the Carlton game was on live  stupid channel 7 lol.
Cash grab, and nothing more. Purchased the app a year ago but now due to an issue on the account being asked to pay for it again. Very disappointed and no response from seller. Last update was 1 year ago so as far as I am concerned the developer abondoned it.
has had AWFUL hiccups today and now can`t fall asleep because of them
cant sleep  so tired! goodnight... maybe :/
it's not good for you when u r busy self distancing lmfao
wow.. tomorrow and then it`s over. i`ll never see some of those people again. it`s kind of sad.
I cant sleep, but im too sore to move
Does not sync. If i enter an item in the agenda. It does not sync with the widget. Sometimes it takes a whole day before it is visable in the widget. In the widget only 2 items are visable. The rest keep saying "loading" for days now. Even if i manually sync.
 i got mcdonalds, surpisingly its not a popular drunk food option.  its sucks that all diners aren`t 24hrs here anymore
Would like questions answered I email my questions for answers & I give my contact info for almost two months now but no one contacts me. This is very disappointing especially when I bought this app. Very poor for business kevin

Subscription based model for better features. Happy to pay $20 once off if I really like an app, but not ongoing costs that can change any time.
 I am in Kuala Lumpur. And I know I vanished, haha! I broke up with my last boyfriend, that`s why I`m back!

App deleted my tasks out of no where, as well as the app seems to be bloated with features. Needs to be more sleek and refined. I dont believe the audience for a to do list app is looking for anything with a lot of features.
_Meir ohhhh ouch dude, I got it now I was drunk last night and didn`t get the context. Sorry dude.
Steve Aoki  sorry. May b nxt time.
 Omg same here! They hurt so much

So far so good... bit expensive having to purchase a yearly basis to access basic functions as color tags and what comes with it. Translation to Greek is not fluent for the price tag / annually I would apprechiate developers look closer at them. Will give it a try before committing on purchasing it per year. On a positive note love the widget (using however nova launcher). Current rating will change based on the experience.
bed. with stomach ache
Not good news  Time for an incredibly hard decision.
 they won`t  guys are retarded!
ugh... only 1 3/4th hour and i will be 19...
I used to really love this app, but lately it won't notify me when the timer is up. It's hard to keep track of how much you're working

 yep and its freezing, i hate winter  im literally wearing blackets
Hicks are mean!
Bears, beets, and... ****, never mind   How about SG1, take-out, and wasabi vodka with ginger ale and lime...
This app was great, but now in 14.1.0 I can no longer click on a project and see all of its sub-projects and their tasks at once. This is a stupidly frustrating change and it completely messes up how I use the app. Why not make this a setting I can change back, OR leave it alone altogether? I will be manually rolling this app back. Thanks for making more work for me guys. SERIOUSLY STUPID "UPDATE".

Every entry gets copied so I end up with 2 of everything, one in the color I designate and the other in the standard color. If I delete 1 I loose both. I used this calendar for years for my business and loved it but the latest update killed it.

thinking of you   why we canï¿½t control our thoughts?
Widget Request: please could you add a feature that pushes undone tasks to the top of the widget? Or an option that removes done tasks from the widget.   Good job on the app otheriwise, I'll repurchase if you can add this, love the snooze function.
YOUR CONDESCENDING ATTITUDE IS NOT HELPING YOR CASE. There is a sublist reorder but NOTHING for the MAIN LIST. THERE IS NO SORT OF ANY KIND says sort by DO DATE or lets you PICK WHAT TO SORT BY, A LOGIC CHOICE. Completed tasks NEED TO CHANGE IMIEDIATELY so you KNOW IT'S COMPLETED & next month IS SET. I DIDN'T SAY IT WASN'T SIMPLE. The INTERFACE is NOT VERY INTUITIVE. I DID LOOK AT HELP & THERE is LITTLE FOR THE MAIN LIST. YOU ARE very IRRITATING so I am going to try other choices.
OOUCHHHH I just pinched my own **** by accident trying to fix my top
Anybody else experiencing painful slowdowns with facebook?
I don't know why they changed it, but I hate the fact that you can't type in the time anymore. You have to scroll, like you're on Wheel of Fortune or something. That is the biggest pain in the behind ever invented!!! I don't mind it if there's a option, but this doesn't appear to give you a choice anymore. Please change it back.

I`m struggling today...Nola woke up at 3:30, so I`m running on no sleep.
Spending $10 once or $5/year for a subscription would make sense to me; but paying $15/year to use a to-do list (when discounted) is really excessive. This is a great tool - actually, I love it; but I find it ridiculous to pay so much just to TEMPORARILY unlock basic features like a calendar. Edit: Since writing the above review, I've found cheaper/free alternatives. The one I'm using is called Treat Yourself. It's free and doesn't look great, but it serves my needs just right and I love it.
got FOXY_ a new brew buddy now my kitchen is gonna smell
i just bit my tongue.  blood everywhere!!!
I used to really love this app as it provides a Todo list widget that can show a lot of Todo list items compacted into a very small space. However it has started showing full screen ads when adding new items so I'm going to be looking for a replacement.
Update: I did all the steps.. still not working... It is getting frustrating 😓 I really love this app. But off late it just keeps crashing. Can anybody help? Updated: Thanks for the reply! There was no auto update option in my phone settings. So, I have disabled auto update in google play. Will it work?
DO NOT PAY FOR UPGRADE!! If you upgrade it just messes the app up. I have to manually change days every morning now. If it weren't for that, it'd be great. Please fix.

Unable to understand the planner

Pretty with nice add ons and integrations but more than once I've gone back to a long list I created to find it gone or reverted back to a very old version, so annoying. Don't need the song and dance this app offers if it can't save a basic list
After 3 years, still does not sync with office 365 business accounts.
So sleepy again and it`s not even that late. I fail once again.
@ Safeway. Place is a nightmare right now. Bumming.
...OOOPS AGAIN, the reply button is the RIGHT of the msg...now I`ll stop spamming
 If they recorded it and sent it to people, they obviously meant for it to get out there.  But if they didn`t, I feel bad.
 how tough was that, just wanted to hug her like my own
It would be better to add a comment on what exactly the time spent for every time we turn the timer on. Now it crash and never open in my new Samsung galaxy S10 lite. Uninstalling it......
 Perhaps they see it as the twitter version of pulling someone`s pigtails? Let me know if that works out for you.
Nobody likes to feel low priority.

i have to poop...   is hogging the shitter
 which case? I got a new one last week and I`m not thrilled at all with mine.
In microsoft todo, there is no such option like in wunderlist to comment on assigned task with others and others can get notification on their mail, kindly add the feature if possible
My attempts at writing tonight seem to be failing.
My events show up at the wrong time in my calendar even when they've been manually entered. What's the point of a planner that doest let you plan.
Failed at the first hurdle, couldnt customise my character to even get started. Next button worked thats about it. galaxy S8
_X sorry about that.
Morning all. I appear to have a bit of a sore head. Perhaps the bag of pork scratchings for dinner wasn`t such a good idea
 that is soooo scary! Be careful! We only have one Kirstie!
The new notifications are atrocious. The don't follow light or dark theme in Android 10, they don't work well with Wear OS, and they turn on my screen when I don't want them to. I'm now getting reminder pop-ups when i don't want any and the option to turn them off is gone. 10/24/2019 - I downgraded to v5.2.3 and got the Reminder Pop-ups option in Settings > Notifications back. When I update to 5.3.0 the Reminder Pop-ups option is replaced with Notifications and Notification Font options.
im slowly losing followers one by one.
Oh... I miss the Piano.

I click undo but retain the XP. No real theme or this app, very bland. Needs character
 we`ll test that theory  with no right arm to strum with.  Got a feelin I`ll be humming my new tunes for a while
Todoist has LOTS of bugs after update. Most annoying: 1 no longer able to select multiple tasks at a time, 2 when writing a task, keyboard blocks view of task box so you cant see what you're typing, 3completeled subtasks used to remain but crosses out, not it disappears (forcing users to relearn how to use the app), and 4 some tasks scheduled to appear under today does not. Makes you question the integrity of the app. I see no benefits to recent changes. Only bugs.
#liesgirlstell  a guy calls her phone to see if the number is real ) ohh my phone isn`t working . try tomorrow .

 **** - doesn`t show how people are more conservative in blackjack
Up already  Nooooooo!
I tried 3 or 4 times to download this app, import my Wunderlist data, and share lists with my husband. Each time it failed miserably. Not trying again - finding a better app.
awsome application.. i purched it.. but i just want notifation should be blinking on phone like alram clock .. plz add this type of features.. the thing diplys in notifaction should be flash on main screen From last 10 month it's not getting synchronising.. Plz do something @developer We paid for it
NOT into your ads. I've had your app on my phone for YEARS. Uoure about to be deleted for a Google calendar. Sorry.
 weird trigger. You should definitely ask him about them on monday, dude...  ****.
- im hungry...but there`s no food at mah house.
 im sorry
Or this, for that matter: http://bit.ly/SS6Yp  So jealous.
5 and a half more hours of work  I wish I had something to do..
 I could do with another one now myself. was back to work on Monday after being off for 7 weeks  not good.
Worked great at first but continously does not sync completely with Alexa. I only use this app as a shopping list with Alexa, but when it only shows 4 of 10 items on my list it's pretty useless. The purpose of the list is so that I don't have to remember the 10 items I told Alexa to add to the list (which show up on todoist)
for years I use ticktick, I love it so much, I rated it 5 in Play store.. But the recent several changes to the app are make the app getting worse and keep getting worse than before. I incredibly sad and disappointed. for years I rely on ticktick as my todolist app, and now I have to find other alternative that can be as good as ticktick that I know before. that's not an easy thing to do
 the worst kind of news
Ugh have to report again monday
Viewing the sub-project tasks inside the main project was an integral feature of the app that I used daily. Removing this without warning as if it were an 'improvement' is unacceptable and makes the app borderline useless for me, and as such I will begin looking for another app that can better suit my needs. Removing features and making pointless changes is no way to retain users.
AAAAARRRRGGGHHH! there is a huge spider in the towel pile, *cries* glad Kerbear isn`t here  sorry mum cant bring the rest in
 You know I am so ashamed. I did not watch a single episode of the new GH season.  I kept falling asleep, so I gave up.
 I missed you guys this morning. I`m in Tacoma w/ no KGW to start my day.
*pokes and runs away* ... I WANT SUGAR !
I hate TweetDeck when it reaches access limits
Under sooooo much stress lately
This app used to be great. Now it is garbage. A few months ago it started doubling a few tasks - no problem, I just delete the extras. Now I get 5 to 10 copies of every task I delete. It is worthless.   I can't forget the wait times to open the app, up to 8 minutes of staring at a black screen.   Oh, and the fact that in the past week or two it started giving me ads even though I have been using the paid version for years already.   I let them know a couple weeks ago and got no response.
is still pretty depressed about losing her hello kitty necklace
Hate fighting
a headache once again ugh
When I first downloaded the app it worked seamlessly, but once I upgraded to the Pro version it began to lag and slow down. I can't access my timeline, store or achievements anymore and it's slow run time is making the app so tedious to use. It's becoming an awful app for me
 ... rather than outdated & bigoted at worst, and outdated, patronising, imperialist, monoculturalist & self-righteous at best.
 I`m sorry to hear that! that makes me sad

_one Could use GarageBand though it`s probably overkill.
_zaboo its ok, it just hurts abit i thought i was doing a good job... if i was rude to people i could understand...  x
My prior app isnt any more and they automatically imported all content into this one. The most annoying part is that each item now adds to the bottom of the list, instead of the beginning, I need to fiddle with sorting on each list to fix this and the sorting takes space on the screen! Waste of time each time!
 that happened to me so often, i hated it. every time i moved to a username that i thought i`d love, i moved soon after.
Colin Powell rocked yesterday on CBS. Cheney needs to shut the hell up and go home.Powell is a man of Honor and served our country proudly
Soo tired, couldn`t get enough sleep
apparently it`s starwars day today  I like this . Shame I have revision though.
I really wanted to love this app. It does exactly what I need. Unfortunately it's riddled with bugs. Mostly with repeat tasks. Main one being. If your phone is powered off at a reminder time, it will break the reminder. Resetting the task brings more issues. Also takes 15min for the app to sync with the widget! Contacted "priority support" (one reply a day). Seems to have no real interest in fixing the problems. Blamed it on Nova Launcher. Same thing happens with Samsung launcher.
I`m terrified about the surgery next week

Costs money to make pixels darker
gutted - the handbag I wanted has been sold!
insects have infected my spinach plant :(
 oh my god. i can`t do the end of the dance  *sob*
The latest update is terrible. I always organized everything by date of the reminder, which is usually set on the day that it's due, but now I can't even see the due date of each task. I have to click on each task for the the date to appear. In addition, I usually organize each task by tags, the date, recurring if needed, and other details. There's no easy way to adjust all these details anymore. You have to click on each separate icon to fix these to what you want. I use the app begrudgingly.
is still waiting.
 hey Bow when yu comin baxx 2 thaa 614 we miss yu hun  ...614 all day!!
last night`s paper writing session=still not done. I need to prioritize better.
I think I should hire one of those tranlsators.. because no one ever understands me....
Just had my hair cut it looks like ****
I started getting notifications but all came at the same time instead of their specified times, so just removed them and no longer use. Biggest feature I would like see fixed is there seem to be issues with using the "Today" option for the task list Widget. Sometimes will only show one task and sometimes when I can complete all my tasks, the next day the list doesn't refresh, still says "All tasks are done!"
I`m suffering from restless legs and butt syndrome.
I've had this app for a few years, and it worked well until the last several months - it's gotten increasingly buggy and will do things like "forget" you checked off tasks as completed and re-list them as incomplete between closing and re-opening the app.  It also had been freezing more and more frequently, to the point where that happens at least once a day, and now I can't even load certain screens.  Because of this, I will not be renewing my subscription this year and will be using another app.
This app was everything I needed, I loved it. But after thenlast update I cannot log in to my account so I cannot see my daily schedule. Will not trust it again and I have already unistalled it. I need an organizing app which I can trust. Fortunately all the events were synced to my google calendar but notes and tasks didnt.. So I dont know if I am forgeting something that is pending now.
 Too bad.
It`s called communifuckingcation.....learn it, know it, do it. These stupid **** people!
Nancy Pelosi gave the worst commencement speech I've ever heard. Yes I'm still bitter about this
Is there no way to assign a specific color to an event? I like to group my meetings by color. If I can't do that, the app isn't useful for me.
Recent major update has strongly impeded on usability of app. I understand and appreciate the focus on subtasks and some other features, however I think the developers have severely misjudged the actual most common user stories. Was always a big fan, paid subscriber for many years, but this update was a major letdown. Unnecessary changes for something that was working almost perfectly.
Not very user friendly and very less interactive
 tolddd you there was thunder! ew now it`s all rainy D: i`m scared!
missing my man, two months is so long to not see him
Going to REtake my Softball photo because Patrick`s Studio is a piece of ****. Back here for chores. Some Friday, huh?

I have the biggest headache ever. My photosensitivity is getting OUT OF CONTROL!! Help.
This app was fantastic when I first downloaded. However, now my monthly recurring task pops up evey day. No idea why. when it wasn't doing that before. I've tried deleting and adding again. But, it does the same thing. Really annoying.
Apps been broken from the moment I download need fixing
Don't buy the premium version of this app. Synching doesn't work. Stick with the free version, which would be 4 stars
i hate being sick. i miss   and 
 now my heart isnt cold  but im still missing you.
Same issue as Don Smith who wrote a review on 10/10/19. Will consider this app but the lack of slide visuals and character visuals makes the app in-op. Current phone is the Google pixel 4xl......perhaps I misspoke in regards to the reply. My issue is not with the visuals but the lack of visuals. Everything is blank for me so literally can not see half of the content.
Like many others, the new big update has severely hindered my ability to use the app effectively. What used to be simple is now cumbersome with a 3x increase in the number of clicks to accomplish simple tasks. It wasn't broken, why did you have to 'fix' it. I'm hoping they roll back some of these changes, if they don't I will probably need to look elsewhere for a todo app.
 Yeah, if I lived on the rez, I`d already be dead.
hard to use
Mixed great app but don't by premium. Won't work without play services and developer unresponsive
Poor  `s mom just told her she looked like a ****.  The skirt wasn`t THAT short, and it`s 87 degrees out!
This app is an excellent idea, if only it worked. I have been unable to move off the home screen without it crashing. Its a shame as it has a lot of potential.

This app just "disappeared" two of the recent events I listed in, both weddings. Luckily I thought of rechecking a day after inputting them. This has happened a couple of times already. Too unreliable for work appointments, I might get fired when I rely on this app's widget for work appointments. Close to uninstalling, after I check out a good replacement

 are you still angry with me?
 Yeah, that lying in bed thing`s a bugger for blocking creativity  Worse if you`re pinned down by a pet cat, apparently...
The idea behind the app is nice, but it isn't userfriendly. Finding and adding friends to use it together was so counter productive that it got us to waste time we could be actually doing our daily tasks.
 LOL, such a dork. Hmm, is that book pretty good? Maybe I should check it out. That`s why 4gb sucks  8 isn`t much better.
I`m bored... Don`t want to stay home tonight, but don`t want to spend money  blah

my car is in at the garage & is not coming out anytime soon! last time I heard the gearbox was the problem, still waiting for the quote.
Not sure how this app received such high ratings. It is just making you add events in your Google calendar to create a pie. I don't want to add daily tasks to my Google calendar. I thought this app was going to be more efficient, but it's not.
 Yeah I hate that too!!!! Sorry ur goin thru that
good app but skills glitch out all the time.....fix this for 5 stars

I've been trying to figure out how to have a custom time set for the "add notification" options, and there doesn't seem to be any way. For example, I need to set it to 1 hour and 30 minutes, but there's no option for that. We need the ability to enter exactly the number of minutes and hours we want, instead of only having presets.  EDIT: Now after using it for a while, the app has been plagued with reliability issues. It often is late with the notification by a few minutes, or the service completely stops and I'd have to restart the service. Due to this issue, I cannot rely on this app for anything that is time-sensitive because I'd end up being late for all my appointments and jobs. I've contacted the developer multiple times about this but so far they haven't been able to fix the issue.
My new car is already giving me problems  That cant be a good sign.
I miss my peanut gallery
I'm just not finding time to work with this app. So by no means the star rank im giving the apl is just a TEMP ranking.

Excellent app, highly recommend, have been using this app since it was first getting established and was advertised on reddit. However I cant log on anymore :( I had access on my old phone and now on my new one it says my email address is not in the database! How can I get my access back? This is the only app I like!
I`m slowly reallizing how this burn I got at work 5 hours ago really sucks
 No it`s not sad. Should make you proud
 I don`t find this stuff amusing any more
Can feel a headache growing.
Not too good for Android! I have the App in my two different type of phones and subscribed for the premium one month in my Android and found out that that version doesn't have all the features described as for example impossible to find or use the sub task feature, create or editing folders, etc. etc. Very disappointed about that, because the App concept seems to me very good. :(
 l`m on 3 days too matt. No fun this weekend.
This app doesn't seem to show multiple calenders for the same google account. P.S. In my Google calendar, the desired calendar has got Sync enabled still the issue exists. P.S. 2- In the My Calenders menu, it is not even showing the second calender which I have made for the same google account.
Doesn't have a built-in backup and even after exporting a backup file - an error shows up. Additionally, the support email is an invalid email address. A total waist of time for setting it.

Just woke up. I dreamed I had 9 new emails! Sadly, it was just a dream
feel crappy today
Tasks that I change dates does not move to the new date assigned. I'm dismayed because I am a premium member. Moreover, it doesn't have a 1 week or 7 day folder. Apart from the calendar, I also want to see a 7 day list or folder...

Just found out my Abuelo in Aguadilla is not doing well
Despite various updates to "fix bugs" the first few screens of this app are still completely broken on Android. The app beyond sign-in still functions...but that's it. The game aspect is weak, the app isn't very well designed, and the tutorials tend to be broken on Android as well. I prefer apps like Fabulous, which I think approaches the subject of mental health and habit forming in a much better way.
This is just a re-skinned Samsung calendar, don't waste your time

_xo  wicked , what time you leaving? how come you cant stay the night
 i know, i was on the list, but had to miss out b/c of conflicting plans  how did it go?
 Bummer- that is a bad experience.
I hate being young
I actually really like this app but one of the biggest features that needs to work properly for my routines is repeating reminders. I set reminds for monthly bills such as rent, and set it to repeat "monthly". But when I complete the task, it uncompletes itself the very next day WITHOUT setting the reminder to the next month. Basically if i set it to November 1st, it tries to remind me again, daily, on november 1st. It doesn't work. I love the app but the most important feature is broken sadly.
Legs are hurting because I was standing up all day.
The new version is too complicated to use and I could not find any directions. However, a application with a easier use will be my preference.
I agree with a previous user that recent updates are making the app worse. I've used this app for several years and loved that my to-do list syncs across devices, but recent changes (specifically, deleting completed tasks instead of leaving them visible/able to be restored, despite modifying settings) make this app basically useless for my purposes. I'm disappointed that I need to find a new app after so long using this one.
 You`re right- you don`t do sympathy very well
 too late  I`m already on the bus goin home  what the he`ll u talkin about drinkin tea????

Hi there, i would like to know if this application is for free or do i need to pay for it? Thank you for your answer.
#RantsAndRaves The worst thing about GM (concord / pleasant hill / martinez): is the fucking UAW. ..   http://buzzup.com/4ueb
latest update has not fixes bugs that occur every day.frustrating to use.sometimes it won't save,will just have a loading loop.Some basic things are not customizable like the calendar starting on Monday or the date format ,doesn't keep track of activity data correctly . Please focus on getting the app to work instead of focusing on superficial appearance! was thinking of paying for a subscription but what's the point if the money will not go towards making the app usable & less temperamental?
The privacy policy is just ludacris. Especially that all personal and private data (vids + pics and the rest) is also collected for the appmakers own "interests". 😳😳😳
Ugh its really hot today already and its not even noon yet  i want ice water!
Missing how it used to be
 JUST like to clarify that I am a unable to acc. review vibrators as have not testrun any. *not an invitaiton for freebies
Great app to keep focused but too many glitches as you can tell from other reviews. For me it has crashed in the passed. Currently the problem is that the vibration alarm doesn't come on when I'm done my timer, so it's literally failing at it's secondary job, to keep time of your session (1st job is to keep your phone away from you during your study session). Because of the glitch, I have missed a bus a couple times b/c the timer didn't ring. I am displeased. Also the new updates seem unoriginal
Ewww just printed my new I.d badge thingie 4 work n eww my picture. I took so many n they were all ugly
Strange thing. When I mark recurrent tasks as done in web desktop version into the Upcoming section.
apparently even Novell Moonlight doesn`t work on my Jaunty
Some pretty basic standard features in other apps are missing. The options menu is very limited with no option to default a tasks due date, project, category etc. These have to be entered every single time a task is created which makes adding quick tasks on the fly very annoyingly slower than other apps. There is no sorting options or filters on views (ability to create custom views does not exempt this feature from being useful). Too many clicks to edit tasks, eg notes/comments, rescheduling.
I hate it! I loved wunnderlist, it was just perfect. Why did you guys have to change what was great??? This new App is so unclear, things don't stand out the way they did. I imported all my info from wunderlist and it is all messed up. I will be looking for another app and give up on you asap!
 It`s becoming a very tough race. Linda is indeed very talented. But someone has to go every week.  We cut two this week.
I have had this for years and even have the pro version. Today the application is staying I do not have pro, when I go to on app purchase it even detects purchased but will not give access to pro features.
My car broke down.   Time to start looking at getting another.  If its not one thing its another.
It gives the option to add a local calendar but doesn't let you use it unless you also give permission to use a Google or Outlook calendar. Kind of defeats the purpose of doing a local-only calendar if I can't actually use it.
sooo im 20 n im just now findin out i have asthma
Was outside playing ball with dogs, now all hot and sweaty
Disappointing... I have been happily using this application for years now, but the last few updates appear to have caused more problems than they fixed. One example: when you create an event that's further away than a month, the app will AT ALL TIMES change the date and time to incorrect ones. It has done this EACH time for me over the last months, changing the dates and times for no reason; you can imagine this is a deal-breaker for a planning app...

Please give us a way of disabling the red notification dot. It serves no purpose if I can't tell what it's for. Get rid of it or make it more clear what it's indicating. UX should never be an afterthought.

This calendar would be a 5 star except for 1 MAJOR issue. The sync is unreliable. For example, items placed on my calendar via Google or Gmail within the previous 24-48 hours usually do not appear no matter what sync settings I have or how many times I manually initiate a manual sync. All other calendar apps I have tried do not have these sync issues.

 i missed the game
is sad she got her plans cancled
Too much advertisement. Not motivating nor relaxing
I tried it years ago and never really got it going. Then I switched to Wunderlist and became an organized machine! Now Wunderlist is being retired, so I thought I'd try again, guessing it would be much better by now and that my ability to use it to my advantage would be vastly improved. Nope. No ability for folders or some other way to group lists together so I don't have to flip through all my lists to find the one I want. Not even a list view to make them easier to find.
Chemistry is not fun..
App has so many problems. I started experiencing them once I paid for the pro version. No one has responded me back from the support to solve my issues. Some issues are as below. 1. Not fully supporting the app whitelist which is a big obstacle in working. 2. Not counting the exceeded time even after setting it up again and again. 3. Took so long to log in after reinstallation as I tried that to solve the above mentioned issues. My advice : Don't pay for this app till these issues are resolved
i love this app but it reads my texts. i left one in draft and it suggested it as a Todo item. i couldn't find any way to get it to keep is "eyes" to itself. not about it.
I uninstalled the app and installed it again and now the app works, but ive lost all my progress and my forest... this is so dumb this app forces me to uninstall and then i dont even get my progress back

This is worst task game in my life
Not as good as wunderlist. Supposed to verify before deleting but it doesn't. Lost entire list by accidentally touching and yes, I have it turned on in settings. At least with wunderlist you could see deleted items and undo. Going to find something better than this then uninstalling.
 say hi to me, i`m depressed cause i cant see you
i`m bored : hope your wlan will go today!
Crippled version without even a way to purchase outright. EDIT: I'll be clearer. Many apps features are disabled. But there is no way to just buy the app. The only option is some ongoing payment subscription which makes no sense as this app does not provide any ongoing or backend service, it's just an app! and a simple one at that. It's like going to buy a water bottle and going to check out they take your credit card info and charge you the same price every year that you use the bottle. Bottom line, it's just a scummy business practice.
Just got back from school! Ugh I don`t want to go to the dance tonight

I'd like it except the widget is the most important feature for me. It displayed my inbox for about a week and now comes up blank. The tasks are there tho. I can read them if I open them, or open the app. :-( You're not the only organizer with this problem tho. Android 9.
i misss my phone,
I had really begun to depend on this app and was having fun. Then I downloaded the update. I now have NOTHING. Not even the IMAGE of an avatar, there's just NOTHING THERE. I have no experience, no level, no coins, NOTHING. I was having a really awful day and this was just icing on the cake. There was so much I put into this game. How can I remember all of the tasks I scheduled for myself? I am so so discouraged.
please do not let me get obsessed, whatever or whoever is in charge of my actions  you`ve been doing such a bad job lately
; keeps getting such delayed responses. why is my internet so messed up?!
The app is not working well since the latest update (2.37.0): the app crashes a lot when creating or editing tasks, the reminder for tasks and meeting are not working (notifications are enabled), so that makes the app useless. Reinstalling the app doesn't solve anything.
 It`s gonna be hot here today too. today is Ryan`s last day of pre-k. I can`t believe it!  I`ve been a SAHM since I had him!
why do i need to pay for basic features such as showing your tasks in month view? it's a calendar app, those are stuff you need to see... can't believe you need to pay premium for a calendar todo app to show your freaking todos in the calendar

I remember the days when you bought an app and owned it.. Now every developer wants to lock you into a lifetime subscription process where they can charge you for eternity. I simply refuse to rent my own notepad.
Ok so I`ve now got a bit of a bad back after lifting all drum hardware into my car   downer.
My go to for years. Until the last update. Ads used to be unintrusive. Now you have to wait 10 seconds after every calendar update for the ad to run. Uninstalling now.

Watching Scrubs season 2. Oh I`m gonna miss that show
I had given 5 stars in Jun 2017. I'm changing it to 1 star because of the full screen ads which cannot be dismissed. I'm grateful to the developer for creating this nice looking calendar app and was happy to tolerate the ads in the free version but the full screen ads really disrupt the process of adding an event to the point where it becomes intolerable. I'll just switch to Google calendar which syncs better anyway. Thanks for the few years of a great app.

why does twitter hate me i cant put no photos on my page
Has no sign in option only export and the file won't open, so unless you have an IT friend you lose your file which meant all the stuff I put in tasks has gotten lost. If the developer revolves this is I will edit this review.

Heyy, Im Not feeling so good cuz of wat happened yesterday in the car accdentt.
After updating.. Ads took over the screen.. Disappointed.. I'll look into other calendar apps as alternative.
 harrump gagging for beer, noone wants to play
It could be a very useful app but it is not very intuitive. Why should I set up the date in google calendar and not directly in the app?
Doesn't show character customisation, think it needs an update
TGIF, too bad the weather sucks...
Great app but only if it was an offline app i would've given it a five star... please fix this...
 indeed, we live a life on the edge of things, and one foot foul of the law!!
 ... much more injustice than we can imagine now. It will get worse before it gets better, I am afraid. No doubt here. Sorry
I was trying out the routine trick. I set the times and dates, but it just wouldn't work. Please help.
 YAEH! THANK GOD IM HOME!...it suekd and we were kicked out of a church.
Notifications and reminders doesnt work
this is the worst day ever, i`ve been told im a chav
I couldn't figure out a way to sync with my Google Tasks, and then now the app won't uninstall from my watch.
 your knowledge of X-men is starting to scare me
Closes everytime I try to add a note, event or anything else since last update
 and what about me, huh? I`m crying. Did U forget me?
I haven`t seen Muffin in two whole days!
Sorry, not Impressed I'm sorry to leave a poor review, but I thought it best to let the developers and others know I had so many challenges with it I wouldn't know where to begin. :( UPDATE: Although I initially gave the app a one star, I upgraded to two because their response was kind and professional. They asked for details of the challenges I had with the app and were genuinely pleasant to correspond with. So if you have a complaint, share kindly because they really do care. :)
Damn you North Korea. http://bit.ly/KtMeQ
 omginorite! I`d be all fancy and tophatted all the time, it`s really too bad I can`t grow a handlebar moustache..
I was trying out to any.do free version. I had spent quite a bit of time making lists and suddenly one day they were entirely inaccessible. Look like they let me put in a lot of dataand then after a certain point decide to hold that data the hostage until I paid them. I decided to not use any.do because after I pay them and started making more list, would they suddenly didn't demand that I paid them more per month in order to access all the information I had taking the time to put in?
Customer support is completely unresponsive. I purchased the upgraded version and it doesn't sync as promised. There has been no help on FB, email, nada. Kinda sucks TBH. The app is nice. The Android widget is what makes it great. Plz fix the sync issue and I'll update my review if your customer support reaolves the matter and makes things right with me.
Sunburn on my knees

 Aww I feel bad for the lil ****. He look like he know what`s coming
Not Working On Xperia E1!
Not sure why everyone's given this such high reviews. The reminders don't work for me, which makes the whole point of having this app useless
So effing tired  http://bit.ly/e0ZFz

I am so bored, i really don`t know what to do!
The sad thing is that it didn't allow to sync data. It requires pro version to be purchased
 i want you to go walking with me!! but i still miss my satan
DON'T BUY PREMIUM! You have to pay for an entire year upfront. And If you change your mind about the app, like I did, due to its odd inconsistent behavior with reaccuring tasks and reminders. You're given 48 hours after the 7 day trial to qualify for a refund. After that you're screwed. All most all of the issues started happening after that period ended. They obviously know they have problems with the app, just read their robotic responses to issues. ANY.DO HIDES BEHIND TOS INSTEAD OF HELPING
just took my shirt off and my back is COVERED in blisters  http://bit.ly/vUiXG

going to my bff`s. haha. but thats in like 2 hourssss sooooo...calllll me. actually darn, i have hw
 being sunburnt is horrible
I couldn't understand it probably my fault but I find it complicate and I like to organize my day like without go and add on my calender just on this app but like I said it's probably my fault / gonna try this app again later maybe like after couple of different updates
you ever come across something that reminds you alot of the one person that completely broke your heart? cause i just did
The app per se is good. Sadly the customer service when you have an issue is no where to be found. For about a month i have sent emails since the app after an update went back to basic, even after paying the pro version about 3 years ago. No help has been provided after all this time. In my view, you can make it or break it when you take care of your paying customer or ignore him. It seems like they dont see it that way. Perhaps now they will pay attention.
Off to Nanaimo 2day... missing my son already and i havent even left yet

I cannot imagine how an app managing the same tasks with outlook for desktop, is not connecting with it at all. You cannot see categories that you set in outlook! If you really want a similar to outlook app then see Tasks & Notes

I downloaded this app because I thought that the game concept for to-do lists would be really cool. Opened the app just after downloading and tried to register an account and it wouldn't let me log in. Waited another hour and it still wasn't working. Call me impatient but I just couldn't use an app that refused to work.

Garbage. The one time I can't remember if i checked the notification for taking my medication or not, there was no way to go and see which days I checked it or not. What's the point of that?
I`m so pissed off today n sadly.. Can`t even share the reason here
i want to go out tonight, but i ain`t go no money and no one to go with   any takers???
_nichole i miss my earrings  lol you should let me know when your close by
Theres always something shifty to me about an app that shouldnt need a subscription for doing the absolute minimum. They make setting reminders too complicated and they're hoping you forget to end your free trial before they start doing automatic payments, that's just how most of these apps work. You're better off setting an alarm on your phones clock and having that on repeat than you are using this.

a reminder app that does not remind. Set several reminders and none alerted when the time is due. previous versions worked great until lately (new version 5.0?) I've tried locking the apps, turn off battery optimization etc...nothing worked.

Task management is terrible. it will kill the apps running to draw over the screen. frequently my camera shuts off because tick tick notification.
I swear, now my dog is having anxiety issues.
 Doubtful! It`s going to be on 24/2!
The app is good to use overall. Except, as a number of other folks have said, it does not sync. And there is no response from the developer on this issue. Annoying to have paid for an app that claimed the sync feature, when it doesn't actually work. What that means is you lose all history every time you change the phone.
 I am like the most saddest person on jtv right now because you are not on
I would give this app 5 stars, but if you press "silence notifications," you can never turn them back on.
oowww...why do wisdom teeth hurt so much
Can't get it to finish installing and I have plenty if room. Gets to 97% and then stops. I will revise my review if I ever get to try it!
i just got my nails done n i already messed them up  Alejandra <3
Total waste of money.
Nowhere near as good as Wunderlist which I've been using for several years. Gutted that Microsoft are stopping Wunderlist in favour of this very poor substitute. Not feeling the love for Microsoft anymore...
Learned a lesson the hard way. Lost my USB stick and backup was a month old
 and what a scary reflection it was! thought you were going to wizz your pants
Came back to see if I can use the app since I do like it, it's a great idea. I'm my case: I need to be able to add calendar events, reminders in one app 100% essential and afaik this isn't supported? I have a shared gcal, a personal and another work one and all of them needs to not only show up for me to organize life itself. They also need to be managed in the app I use for reminders etc for this to do what it needs for me. Not just reminders, calendar events needs add, edit. Back to any.do
Not in a good mood.  My mama`s away with my sis so can`t talk to either of them and my boy can`t see me this weekend as planned.
I am sick, very sick, sore throat and flu
never mind it`s closed  sorry Miley
"Repeat function doesnt work, so you can't set up tasks to be repeated 
daily.. You can basically create a list and then delete items as they are 
completed. That is all this does. Basically useless for anything other than 
a shopping list."
I hate watching the News. Why do such awful things happen?
Cant re-edit time that ive set, necessary to delete and redo the process. Also, i need a reminder for every hour, and had to create 24 reminders instead of 1 reminder running every hour. Poorly designed.
Useful features ask you to get premium version but when I try I get to this page, which is the app I already have installed. 1/5

However I found it a helpful app helping me to stay focused on my projects, I am disappointed!!! How could you just double or even triple the price of the trees through an update? 👎👎👎 that wasn't not fair!!!!
 Wow, you mom has a lot of energy. I`m getting tired just reading your tweet and ur living it.

Why did you remove the ability to enter the main app from the widget? The widget also has some serious performance issues and freezes often. Other than that it's a great app, does its job and the web interface is really useful when you're on desktop.
You have to buy pro version

trying to switch from wunderlist and the import option doesn't work or give any assistance to troubleshoot. I just get the message "file not found" with nothing else to say where it's looking for the file so I can get it in the right place.

I would rather pay reasonable yearly taxes for "free" fast internet, than get gouged by Time Warner for a slow connection.
Ex happy Wunderlist user, disgruntled with this half-baked attempt. Most of the fine details that made Wunderlist great were omitted (with an option to include them at some vague point in the future), interface does look cleaner but there are fewer details that help tasks being organized visually. For a standalone app it would deserve a 3 star. For an app that is supposed to replace Wunderlist it would get a 2 star. For an app that tries to get users by killing it's better competitor, even a 1 star is too much.
miss my hubby already!
_watkins Oh my gosh ian i always miss you when your on

Not very user friendly. Uninstalled immediately
Great, just great. #Cookoutofthecentury and my wife`s tummy hurts. Just. Great.
To me its not user friendly. I dont like the question up front before a tour of the app. Its very limited unless you pay for the pro version. I think, when picking a routine or something a bar or something should pop up with options or ideas to choose from.
 Ok well from the pic i take it you do. Thats unlucky . Lmao
  i`d give anything to be there. too bad i`m in tennessee.
Took a kind-of nap, too. My tummy hurts.

Fine for tracking, but the reminders stop working after a couple of weeks (this has happened with every new habit I've set up, and I have a premium account) and the developer doesn't respond to support requests.
Have hardly worked out in the last two weeks but am losing weight.  Fear I`m losing muscle!!  Just made doc. appt. for injured foot

 Very. I`m ill and attempting to remember lots, and nothing is going in.
The app was working fine until it started bugging out recently and showing me the wrong dailies. Going back to using just the website now until this is fixed.

This app has some major problems. It seemed to work fine for the first day of running. After the first day no reminders were executed. Any game armor or weapons could never be equipped. it appeared you could equip them but once you left the screen they become unequipped and they never showed up on the avatar. I mainly got this app for productivity and since the reminders do not work I'm not certain I'm going to continue using it unless these problems are fixed.
I'm changing the rating into two stars because the sync feature which previously work fine has no longer work. Looking at the last update I feel like the developer had abandoned this apps, which is quite sad considering this usef to be the best apps on building habit.
Ok the thunder is scaring me
 I bet its cool down in SR, huh? It`s not here. I haven`t stopped sweating since noon when dad and I were packing
Don't install this app.This is forgery. I've used this app for more than 2 years when I changed my mobile phone I couldn't login when I logged in it says "this email account is not in our database" I have the mail to prove that I had had the account in the App.I mailed the company 4-5 times but there's no reply. 2 years of my habit data is lost.

Free, but wants you to pay before using. Social media not required, but wants you to register before using. Popular company, popular enough to remove my last 1 star review and send me an Email disputing it. Plenty of better note taking apps exist. I highly advise against this invasive app.
 Yeah, plus I always totally overspend

I can't cancel my subscription! How can I do that?
nooo i cant be sick...not now! im about to go see my new nephew
 my feelings are hurt
Manage subscription is not given in the app menu
I had a premium. Scam.The app is very pushy and annoying. I couldn't get into 80% of my incoming calls as it blocked the screen so the call doesn't appear on the screen. You only hear it and hopelessly looking for the call screen that you only get once the call is dropped. You have to call back then. Disturbing and annoying. I barely used this app as to maintain it takes a lot of time. I asked them to cancel they said they will not refund as more than 48h passed of yearly(!) subscription.
  that`s not good
My head`s THUMPING.
Awesome tracker yet it seems overpriced in my country way more more than the typical range of $5 its about $10 for me with tax included. Also I don't appreciate the greyed out price being the same as the 33% claimed discounted price very deceiving. Lastly the lack of support for a fingerprint access method is subpart for 2019.
bhai very very very very bad asp
Can't sign in. And there are reviews from October saying the same. So... No improvement over months of having the same issue.

 That sucks about your prints. Sorry
Cannot use because of the 299 entry limit. My most important list was split into 7 lists. The first list segment is full, so I cannot add a new entry to the top of it. I copied my lists from Wunderlist, and several lists got split like that. If it had copied starting at the bottom of the list so the first segment was the one not full, I might have been able to make it work.

I just buy the premium but, the app always crashed can't be open
I regret buying this app. (TL;DR: don't use this app if you ever intend on changing routines or planning.) Changing existing routines is very hard as it simply deletes whatever overlaps in time. So unnecessary and impossible to revert. If you accidentally click PM instead of AM once, your whole day is deleted permanently. Also, every time I want to sync between my phone and my tablet I have to export it to Google Drive and then import it from the other device. Also, you can't copy items or days to another time. Please make this app more user friendly!
What a busy day ... am disappointed that today`s show is a repeat

Frustrating I brought the upgrade and none of the features show up NONE! No "To Do" tab, no widgets nothing. So someone get back to me and explain why the app isn't showing any of the features in your description.
Got it primarily for reminders. It has a lot of settings for how you want your alarms or notifications, but those are pretty useless when they don't work. Didn't get a single notification to remind me of the stuff I set up.
Was a little slow to try this one, but Ben & Jerry`s Mission to Marzipan is a bit of a letdown.
im grounded tonight  i hate stupid silent mode
 ah man, that`s sucks.  What happened to it that`s prompting a reinstall?

WOW i just drank a drink of water - 12 ice cubes that took ages to melt. i now have brian freeze
there are better and simple other apps which provide automatic online sync or backup feature like Micr_oso_ft's to do, and many other. why people think this app easy, it's not. I donated on this app and wasted.
 **** it! Must be Morrisons then
I dont like this random gloomy weather
bad, the reminders not working many times trouble shooting
Man i am being boring today not tweeting  How are you guys?
The new widget is not looking good. Please bring back the old widget or atleast bring an option to make it look like the older version.

Pop up stating " the app has been blocked by the system. Please authorize the app in your device settings. Troubleshooting or refresh background tasks " is flashing on my device. May I know what is this about?
Happy Mother`s Day to every mommy out there
My paradise fly catchers abandoned their nest....  they are starting again... but it`s gonna b tough
I like when this developers claim their apps are free, wait 95% free?! You mean 5% free, if even. Data costs money, stop pretending this crappy apps are free. For an note app, this one is nothing but INVASIVE.
So I played this game , yeahhhhh I lost  I`m inlove ughh....really cause I`m such a fool.
 i chewed up a Starbucks and a Subway gift card at Christmas time, I got in big trouble. I not allowed near purse.
I would love this app only if the notifications work at all. There were no alarms or notifications or pop ups showing in my Oppo F5. I tried tinkering with the system like what was said in the troubleshooting page so may times, yet nothing worked. Would give 5 if I do not have this issue.
 Wish I`d had the balls, but with my 2 kids with me and not knowing how illogical these ppl can be, didn`t want to risk it
: no, I fell and effed my arm up today and now I have to do back drive.
In this app reminder doesn't work

My Birthday weekend! cant find where my ex hid our DANE COOK TICKETS for tomorrow!!! WTF that`s all i wanted for my birthday
This is such a fantastic app. But the time taken to solve out problem that I'm facing for last 10-15 days is leaving the counter-effect. Instead of being focused, I'm more distracted because I am unable to plant any tree and it crashes my phone every now and then. Reported so many times and uploaded every data they asked for but in vain. 1 star is for that !!!! I purchased premium and now I've to go through all this.
Just got back from the grocery store. Now I`m starving and can`t find anything to eat!
Coming from Wunderlist, Todo it's annoying to use. Adding items to a list used to be quick and simple. MS over complicated it.
yeah its Friday! I thought my sis was coming into town turns out she is not!!  so sad! i miss my babies!!!

Great app but with a poor 12hr sync to Google Calendar (with no response from the developer in over a year, after an immediate response). If they cant see this is a problem, that is a problem.

I am not able to sign in to my account. Don't know what is happening but I believe I lost all of my progress
Used to be good until last update, now I can't login to see any of my tasks, appointments, or notes.                                            Edit: Now works since newest update, but I have lost all previous tasks and notes. Very disappointed.
 I know it`s just a sprain. It`s a repetitive injury for me.
Boys are stupid, throw rocks at them
I loved this app until the latest update. Full screen ads that you can't cancel are just too annoying. I'm outa here..
 then i kill Bradies gf and have Bradie
I much preferred Wunderlist!! Could easily copy items to new or existing folders. Was much more versatile!! Why do IT techies have to move 3 steps back each time something new is launched?!! Surely R&D of products they wish to replace should have shown functionality used?!!!!!
Bad experience. The support is the worst ever. And no thought has been put except for the visual ui. The ux is bad.

Would have been nice to know the price before using up my data for download, just to be uninstalled seconds later
This app would be so much better if it didn't penalize you for doing your habits for many days in a row. Instead of getting more experience, coins, you get less the longer you do something. You should be rewarding the habits that people are building, not telling them that once they have the Habit they're going to get less for it. Otherwise, this app would get five stars for me.

The app will put by default new tasks into Inbox but Inbox is not what you see when opening Todoist. Instead you might see that there are no tasks for the next 7 days. There's no logic in it, app's assistant integrated with Google Assistant fails to find any tasks, even if asked specifically about those in Inbox. Todoist is cumbersome and annoying, it's actually a general problem with task apps: they're too much and fail to actually do what they are made for.

AT&T cheated the system and now I have no Green Day tickets  **** you AT&T!
The app is very good. Giving one star because, data sync doesn't work even for paid version. So if you change the phone, you lose all tracking history. And as others reviews are saying there is no service by developers.
I know I shouldn`t be saying this but **** it..I`m **** as hell  http://twurl.nl/8q6cjc

I am sitting at work watching the clock.  It isn`t moving fast enough.
It amazes me how Microsoft took over an amazing app like wundelist and ruined it completely. It's a real pitty that wundelist will be discontinued in May 2020 . If you don't believe me , just move to DO IT and then have both apps on your phone till May . You keep opening wundelist because of its user friendly interface and functions and the opposite is true with DO IT. I moved to DO IT thinking that they keep it the same with improvements but I was wrong. Searching for new app already.
 ugh. it sounds like a busted cable box then  what time zone are you in?
 Hope the train remembers the way - they can go a bit loopy on bank holidays

 well my daughter is 20 now...thats why I said `I miss those days`...they go by sooo fast
Do not pay for the app. Sync doesn't work , they dont support the app but they are always ready to take your money.
 That doesn`t sound fun
im soooo loney
My student just walked in balling.  She just witnessed her dog getting hit on the street.  I don`t know what to do to cheer her up.

Its times like these that I miss Manila. I`m not feeling up to myself lately
App cannot keep track of an atypical. Everytime I set the day one it just resets after day 5 back to day one. instead of skipping two days and then 2 day 1 like a normal week would work. I'm deleting this app for sure.
Over complicated
Full screen ads ruin it all I've been using this since it was just "business calendar". It was still $7 back then so I wouldn't buy it but would click the ads every now and then. Now with the full screen ads it's practically unusable. Also, before the dev comes in with the stock "the free version has ads" response: no duh it has ads. We didn't pay for the app because its upfront cost is too high so we liked the corner ads. Now you force them to take over our screens. Uninstalled and 1-Star.
updated and the only thing new is ADS. deleting after years of use over multiple phones.
I am doing Geography Revision on Earthquakes!  How Boring!!

"Even after entering an event into the app, it is not displaying on the

im quite upset do I really look under 15 :| they must have thought i was 14 or something ! Whatt ! thats unfair
Has that feeling like when you want to cry but you dont so you get that empty feeling in your stomach and your throat starts to hurt.
So bored.... couldn`t go to a-kon...
@_hayles are u serious???? you touched his ****? ohmygod u ****!!! lol aaaaawwwwwww y did u tell me that!!!
Many times i've used the app for over 65 minutes and every time it'd just freeze and shut down when only 1 second is left. Doesn't plant the tree and doesn't give me the coins. I'm disappointed + upset that i still can't save up for the treehouse that i want.
 There`s very few film/TV jobs, especially in WMids. And I can`t afford to move away yet!  Sorry, I missed you on 107.3!
Cannot create new tags. Even deleted a few to test if it was because I had reached an undeclared quota
i have sore throat. that`s suck.
After changing my email, I cannot use HabitBull's premium features. I have tried emailing support--no response--and finding a way to restore the purchase or even purchase it again, but no such luck. I am forever stuck with the app thinking I have pro, even though I do not. It's a shame, really, for what is otherwise a fantastic app.
 I`m afraid not much  I just realized the true difficulty of this design. I may cry soon. #idmfinal
Really? $8 for a habit tracker? There are other apps that do the same thing for far less money. I don't mind paying for apps, but this seems like price gouging. Oh, and it's $10 if you want the ability to export your data!
First, the app changed my task name. Then, the task just disappeared and was not in the app. Bad app.

Grass fed beef burgers with sauteed mushrooms and cheddar on wheat buns along with a salad. Yum. Poor Kim still isn`t feeling well
This was originally a 5 star app, but now you can only use it by allowing it access to either your emails or Facebook! 😡😡😡 I am definitely not happy to allow this so have deleted the app. Would give it zero stars if I could.
addin to that last comment, was spose to be going to see the jonas brothers 3D movie, but guess what i couldnt go aswell cos im sick
missing Tim!
it was pretty good on my old phone. then when everything was ported to my new one, the app came, but not the lists I'd made. what's the point of that?! I've deleted it.
RT @sportsguy33 The upside to Time Warner: unhelpful phone operators   superslow on-site service. Crap, that's not an upside.

I dont like the dentist...they make my gums hurt
I really dislike the projects thing. Just let me make new lists. I want a list for movies to watch another for gift ideas etc. The best way to do that through this app is subitems which are a pain to deal with. Moving over to wunderlist
trying to do a blend. i know, i suck at them but there`s no harm in trying.
Another simple app with a subscription plan... This is not the right strategy to attract more people... This kind of app should be a one time payment no more. Whatever the number of apps with this strategy, it doesn't make it a good one.
I find the concept of this app absolutely stupid I don't think people are gonna care about if a virtual plant dies if u use an app and the only thing it does is give u a notification as an incentive. What the app should do is whenever someone opens an app forest should open and display over the app this will prevent others from casually using other apps while their work is in progress.
Once installed the app was showing another time zone.
I have had this app for 2 years and absolutely loved it, after an update it would cut on automatically and freeze my phone. I would have to hit the open apps and close it before I could do anything with my phone. I have emailed and explained what it was doing, and I get am email wanting more explanation, so I did. several days later I get an email that wants a video showing. I don't think this will get fixed i paid for the pro version and i will not renew
This is exactly y I hate driving thru dandy - sittin at lights next to a car of asians who r callin out to me & 1 held up a knife  scum!

ah seriously i dont even work with children some how i am still sick!  groundhog friday just got worse.
nothing to do this evening.. MISSING LIFESTORY
Ever since the recent updates.. the app clash and wont work as the PLANT button were pressed .. unless the Wifi/ Mobile data were on.. it works fine. I would give 0 zero star if I could.. running an app in internet connection can be interrupting especially for students. Please fix this issue as I'm wishing to depend on the app with no internet connection (as how it used to in last version)
I see no difference in this and Google calendar

it`s friday night. i`m home. no party this weekend
App seems ok. But they want you to pay a monthly fee just to use a basic calendar. It let's you view the current week. Anything else and you have to pay. So many free ones out there to choose from. Uninstalling.
I made several repeating tasks that are supposed to be repeated weekly by the day of the week. They seem to just multiply and now the same 4 tasks will show up 3 times each on a single day. I can't edit the original repeating ones, I can only delete them individually on the day they show up several times. This is VERY annoying. This app was a waste of my money. I paid for the ability to make repeating tasks. I'm very disappointed.
I wanna go home, but I can`t cause the customers won`t leave... And my boss won`t let me leave either
Someone just bought the domain i planned on buying yesterday ****
I have been a subscriber of the pro version for years when this new version came out I tried it and there were problems. I tried it again and it seems to work well. I tried running with one alarm and now it dosen't stop when I acknowledge it I'm going back to the old version. I have removed pro 2 if the problem pesiststs I will have to find a new calendar. Very frustrated.
I love Wunderlist! Unfortunately it will disappear in May 2020 and be replaced by this app. Me and my husband have installed the new app, imported all our lists from Wunderlist but we cannot share any of them, not even the ones that we previously shared in Wunderlist. I hope they will fix the problem until May.
  I`m soo sad. It`s just on the edges of the pages, but it`s not gonna come out. *cries*

The new interface is cluttered and hard to use. Edited, in response to the query below.  In the older interface, a routine had a separate page for each day of the week. Now it's a continuous scroll. The older approach seems cleaner.
but this little boy still makin me  work during the storm!!!
ughhhhhhhhhhhh  :/

This is good app
Sneezing hurts my back.
I miss my water cuz my well went dry
Still no search for android? Tags can't sorted? If I use this program for even a month I'll have a jumbled mess that will take forever to find things. Unusable. Two stars for calendar integration and manual sort.

Could have been a good free app. Nice design , good ideas but the free version keeps forgetting the task alarm I configured. I put it at 6 but it resets it at 9. Don't know about the paid one.

there is no time table,this app is fake!
 Oh noooooo!!!      I`m so sorry!!  That sucks hard!
Stupid sun i  actually have to work now
The widget doesn't auto update after I add an event. Always need to click the manual refresh button. Same goes for when I delete an event.
trying to finish moving stuff for tonight don`t feel good!!!!!
 everything is your fault moxy...everything.   x
Never commute in the rain. The people get so much meaner to you.
I really enjoy this app but it has just stopped working randomly. I tried to hatch a dragon egg and the app crashed and since then I cant access it. I have tried uninstalling the app but nothing is working. I have even tried to use the website but it doesnt keep track of my exp gained. I am very dissapointed as I really like the idea of the app.
I had to buy this app because I need that larger widget to fit my needs, and you cannot test it out with the free version. Sadly, it's too buggy to be of any use, at least on the AIO Launcher. Still overall better than my last habits tracker, but I feel ripped off.
Now i cant find him  Gonna be a sleepless night tonight
 Not true, you can get worse burns today... don`t forget sunscreen
Incredible tool, awful app. I'd recommend the desktop version of this site to anyone but the app is a bug-ridden mess that overcomplicates simple functions and only works about 90% of the time.

I downloaded this app today but there is a problem that makes me unable to see to-do lists,habits etc. I really want to use this app but I can't do it when I can't see the options. It would be great if you fixed it so I can use it!
My bed had tha nerve 2 call my blackberry askin me where the hell I was.......looks like I gotta go ya`ll  I`ll c u in 3.5hours, after nap
boo (but will I listen?)
I think this app is the best option for a to do list except that the sync is terrible. I just paid for premium and the app will not sync. During the trial the sync between android app and PC app was also very bad. If they could get the connection/sync issues fixed it would be a great app. If I can't access the premium features I paid for in the next few hours I'm going to be requesting a refund...
They took my property

I wanted to delete one item, pressed a millimetre too low, the whole list is gone. About a hundred items lost. This alone makes the whole app unusable for me. Months later: still this same fatal flaw. Seems like MS have no interest in improving this app, sadly
Can't share lists with other people. Garbage app that is much worse than Wunderlist.
OMG - time warner f'ed up my internet install - instead of today  its now NEXT saturday - another week w/o internet! &amp;$*ehfa^V9fhg[*# fml.
I have purchased pro version. I plant a tree for an hour and come after an hour to see the forest destroyed. It has happened more than 3 times. I even left the phone on the app itself. Kindly fix this. When you don't get to see the reward after 3 hours of productive time it really gets irritating and makes me think why did I even purchase this app. Kindly help.
finally graduation no more school ... im sick today
Pay to remind??? Really???
Keeps crashing before I can even sign in.
App looks good but failed to import from Wunderlist twice. Now forced to manually re-enter several dozen tasks. Wunderlist works flawlessly so wondering why retire it.
It just had to rain on me almost a perfect day now my clothes are wet
 aww sorry to hear you are having a bad time. Remember: this too shall pass
it shows adds which kills my time. i mean , this app does not serve its purpose.

Hate I am going to miss the tweet up this weekend
 Sooo SAD I will miss you here in San Diego!!!
Too much spam. Stuff that I don't care for pops up on my screen all the time and blocking those also blocked the reminders I wanted the app for. Also, too many emails. I don't want more clutter to "organize" my life.
This is ok for solo use, but don't count on it to update between two devices. My wife and I found out the hard way when I didn't get steaks at the store. :( Even manual refreshing doesn't help. I googled the problem and it looks like MS Todo has had similar problems for years on various platforms. Anyway, I suggest finding another list app.
It`s Friday... But its only Friday morning. Ugh.

This app is a good idea and I like the fact that it is very good to start healthy habits an get organized but yet, I could not do anything even with the little tutorial at the beginning.  THIS APP WAS NO HELP TO ME ALL I RECOMMEND IS THAT THE APP HAS TO BE A BIT MORE SELF-EXPLANATORY I DID NOT KNOW HOW TO DO ANYTHING!!!!!!!!

Being able to slide tasks up and down on the fly is a critical feature which needs to be brought over from Wunderlist. I plan and order my work day tasks with it and need to be able to adjust the order quickly and frequently. My wife and I also were using Wunderlist as a grocery list sharing tool. Same complaint as we like to order the list to match our path through the grocery store. I see a few people miss this option in the reviews - Without it, the app doesn't work for me.

The app keeps crashing.. I paid for the pro version but the problem hasn't resolved

Almost every feature requires a premium account for 36€ per year... It's not even possible to test these features without subscribing to an annual plan
DO NOT BUY the premium if you need Alexa and/or Outlook to integrate like they falsely claim this ap does or you need any support from Todoist. Outlook integration has never been a synced integration, it only forwards tasks one-way & only works with limited Outlook paid platforms. They have Alexa issue notice seen only when you try to set it up, no warning before buying believing you can integrate both. No Support response yet. I want my money back. Such waste of hours. I feel scammed

It stops sending notifications randomly.
  im trying to fix myself really but i need to stop cutting myself
 Rude.
It's actually a really good app but because you can't disable pop up reminders it becomes really useless. Those pop ups disturb while doing other things with the phone and sometimes even block the screen while driving. I'd like to receive all notifications but only in the status bar, just like any other app.

Wunderlist is the best for me. If you would like to change wunderlist to be Microsoft To Do, please take all wunderlist's features. In this app you don't take 3 features that important things for me. 1. Login using un Microsoft account. 2. "All" task menu 3. Comment feature on each list (this point so make me happy. It used for list that I shared with another person and want to share the actual condition with a comment. Please enhance this app and I will change my rate to 5 star. Thank you:)
only gets spam in her college email account now. What a way to rub in graduation.
Absolutely worthless. This app runs a prohibitively clunky interface that effectively voids the promise of ease-of-life automation. Google Calendar will provide all other services promised by Any do for free with no annual subscription rate. Don't sign up for the free trial. It's not worth getting pinged for forty bucks when you decide you don't like it and forget to cancel it in time. Save your money!
But now talking about today, Oh my GODNESS! Problems, problems, problems. about love, money, math, parents.....that`s enough, isn`****?

I don't get this app
Cannot get it to stop asking me to verify the time zone. Pressed yes, kept asking. Pressed don't ask again, kept asking. Pressed no, kept asking. Finally deleted. I'll use the the one that comes with outlook. It's not as versatile but it doesn't ask me to verify my time zone every time I look at it. Especially when I ask it not to ask me again.
 Wow  That had to be difficult

#Ajax #php! Just thinking about a concept of autorefresh! _chander made a mistake here
WIDGET DOES NOT SYNC/REFRESH PROPERLY. Went back to Wunderlist until at least the widget refresh/sync issue is solved. (using android phone, tablet and windows 10). The following items, which are present in Wunderlist, should definitely be integrated: 1) The option to choose that starred items be moved to top. 2) The option to choose that new tasks be added to top. 3) Folder view in the widget 4) Icons under a task on the widget showing that a task has subtasks and/or notes in it.

This does not work the same as wunderlist. When I sort, I cannot manually move items to in effect do a sort alphabetically within priority. Also when I prioritize items, they don't automatically move to the top of the list. With wunderlist going away, I am going to have to search for a new app. So disappointed.
LAPPYTOP BATERRRY DYING,tryingtofind a movieto watch since im staying in.  and goingto my room.
Garbage makes no sense
It wouldn't let me try the app. It just told me to subscribe.
 am I not good enough
 Exactly! Silent treatment is a great torture method
Tried to plan my weekly schedule with the "routines" function, but it kept randomly changing the times of the events as I made other edits. (For example, an event I set for 4pm changed to 11am when I hit the button "add break before event"). Also annoying that you can't preview the notification sounds, and have to add silly tags to each event such as "housework".

A bad version of Wunderlist.
I like the app overall, but can't stand the monthly subscription. There should be one time payment to access useful features.
It`s so sad  http://bit.ly/b8jTH  I love Kelly! <3
*Update* 11/02/20 USE AT YOUR OWN RISK! As expected, no contact from developers. App has not been updated since 2018. This app was great for a month until it kept freezing my phone. A de/reinstall has now lost all my data and looking at other users with this issue, it looks like it is lost forever because of the sync function never working and no contact from developers. Very upset and disappointed.
:O Job interview today, i`m really gonna mess this uuuup
watching 'That Thing You Do' on Comcast. Missing my boo like crrrrrazy!
_ oh god i just watched it to!! did claire escape? AGAIN!!! it was really quite sad
Once the app reinstalled itself and I lost everything. I still have no idea why it did this. Also, it often doesn't open when I first tap the icon. If I tap it multiple times it eventually opens within a particular task. I found it frustrating and I've now uninstalled it. It would be a great app if some of these bugs could be resolved.
Been using for years. Just about to delete due to the full screen lengthy ads that not only appear when I add an event, they pop up when I'm using other apps. Did a scan using an ad detector app and Business Calender is the culprit. Shame as pervious ad style was OK, this is ridiculous though.

newest update to the widget made it suck. There is not a reschedule button anymore which I used to use to move all my overdue tasks to a new day. Also no button on the widget to open up the main app anymore.
Not only has it broken but it`s Monday!!Does this mean Monday can be fix`d?  ? http://blip.fm/~5jgio
 Yes I do! And I`m still almost at my Gmail storage ceiling! ARGH! I am being FORCED to delete stuff.... or buy more space.
Since Microsoft have taken over it is rubbish. We had wonderlist on 3 devices and To Do wont even sync the 3 devices the same. Time to look for a new app
🔥 UPDATE: Only manual sync works. Down to 1 🌟 until you fix this. Best calendar out there! Love it! It looks great, works flawlesly, erganomics & ease of use is absolutely outstanding and I'm sure it tastes good as well if you could eat it!

 i`m not proud. but os x excels at video/photo editing where the pc lags so much behind.
Office 365 integration doesn't work, so it's basically useless as a business calendar. As a private calendar I don't see any big improvement over Google calendar,but it's not worse either.
 I miss you too, Mojokins! I go there, but not long enough to comment  Will do more this weekend!
New entries need to go to the top of a list, with ir without a star. Still NOT an improvement over Wunderlist.

I was not planning to give a review but it left me no choice since its replacing wunderlist which is very useful app which my wife and I love especially for our grocery lists, now this TO DO tries to replace it but can't even get it to work properly!!! IF I CAN GIVE ZERO STAR, I WOULD!!!

just started using it, but so far so good
The sun is shining and I`m stuck in work
I dont like that it only works with calendar. i dont want a calendar even called "sleep" just to keep it on the graph
I had made an account for this app a long time ago but didn't use it for long and I forgot why until I re-downloaded it today. This is one of those apps that's incredibly frustrating because a lot of the main advertised features are behind a pay wall and/or you have to make an ADDITIONAL ACCOUNT FOR. Paying more than $1/mo for a list app is ridiculous. If anything it should be a one-time purchase.
So my life has come down to nothing more then making choices ill only regret later
Got hold of the Premium version with high expectations but was disappointed on getting to know that the habits created on a device is not appearing on another device with the same account. Going back to "Loop".

I don't understand why do I have to turn on the screen when I grow up the tree. When my screen turns off because of inactivity for 10 minutes, tree dies again. I installed this app to focus on my work (not my phone) but this app keeps requiring me to turn on the phone. It's paradoxical..

Do not download this app. There are Ads everything you use i (as of Feb 26, 2020), despite what the developer says about the "18 hour". Just read other reviews and you'll see that the intrusive Ads have killed this free app. Look for another similar app
I transitioned from Wonderlist. There are a couple of things I don't like. When the list is sorted any way then you can not drag the items in the list. This makes it very hard to organize long lists. Also, I would like to have the option of adding to the top of the list as well as the bottom. Otherwise the app is good for what I need it to do.
I used to like, even love this app. It was great. Now though, every time I add an event on my calendar an ad comes up and stays there until it is finished. It's awful! So far the ads have not been inappropriate, just annoying. I don't think that going to the pro version would fix this. I don't even know how to find the pro version to purchase as it doesn't show up in the play store. Super frustrating. I don't want to find another app. I just want this one to work without the silly ads.
Wff
 WHAT! That`s horrible! To purposely write about it to a bunny is just mean & cruel!    Not to mention just plain tacky....
I loved this app at first, but now when I change my task dates/times, it doesn't actually change them, and continues to alert me at the original time even though I've clearly changed it. It's very annoying.
Now the mosquito truck is waking me up

****, got Chili Beans on my shirt  I hate that I can be a messy eater. Such a lady!
 i am sorry i don`t like girls ~that way
Sorry for the triple twitter post, was having trouble w/Stocktwits account.  I try not to clutter up the Twittersphere!
It was a great application but the lastest versions don't notify anymore about events and reminders.. I'll uninstall the application because it's useless. It's ridiculous they know the problem and don't do anything to fix it
poor bella is in the ER with her first and second ear infection since both ears are infected. Her screams were blood curdling!
Freakin` frustrated why can`t my coach realize that times are hard ain`t nobody got the money to buy cookie dough for no new uniforms

Routines don't last forever any more
I woke up an came to the realization that I can put it off as much as I want, but I need 2 drop some friends. Dammit!
There are more effective, and honest, ways to turn a buck in the Playstore. Crippling your app with a paywall only drives home just how unnecessary the app is.
I love how personalisable this app is and the widget is fantastic. The weather app doesn't always work and my tablet and phone won't sync tasks even when I ask it to manually. 👎
Just spoke to Keith Urban`s record company, we can`t get him on the show till we`re back from holidays  sorry Jack, we`re trying mate!

It smells badly of garlic
Since you have put advertisements in app i say goodbye.. On top of that an update came up and isn't possible to view description of booked day unless you click on it. Disappointed.
 he thinks he`s a gangsterrr  his **** don`t even fit in G Unit. & I know :| )))))
is hitting the streets. 40 hours living with Lexington`s homeless. No food...no bed...no problem. No Facebook or Twitter...  Pray for us.

I need a friend right now  , I feel like mmmm ... sosad

When I checklist Today's note, automatically Overdue's Note checked too?? what's wrong..??
 Sorry - I have failed to grasp your meaning
I miss you
Tired of hearing stories about everybody going to Ibiza...
App works pretty well, but if they want me to list out all events and plans in my life, their Privacy Policy needs to get stronger and be better defined. "We collect your data; here's a vague description of what. We keep it as long as we've decided we need to; and we won't tell you how long that is. We also completely change this policy in a way that we're break the Policy you may have originally agreed to, but it's your responsibility as the user to make sure we don't break our end of the deal. Don't like this? Delete the app" .. basically the Privacy Policy. Not exactly trust encouraging. Fix this in a privacy friendly way and I'll change my review
'Isn`t she lovely? Isn`t she beautiful?' Sorry Stevie, you`re not really in a position to make that judgement  #steviewonder
 Sorry Mike, was assuming it was music that was missing..I don`t know then.. a mystery..
In worst case cenario, I`ll show up on OFFF with a white mask, and scare everyone. Even better: everyone should wear a mask besides me.
 and you suck horribly  the world is at an even balance
tierd.i just want to talk

The reminder doesn't work at all.

on no bsg might just have made me cry
It was great before, but lately it sends notifications whenever it likes. It doesn't notify according to schedule anymore. And now, it doesn't notify at all.

Doesnt feel good!  but I cant miss work tomorrow!
_McLife yeah that is the one thing i hate about tweetdeck
Gettin my cardio on right now. Walkin to the train station awww I so miss the gym
Reminders are kind of a core feature in a to-do list app. Why should I have to pay for it? The app is fine, but I can't use the reminders.
The pool is just not fun without Tim in it...
kate is leaving me all by my lonesome
 my riding time has been dismal too during these rainy weeks.  haven`t been able to make myself to go to the gym instead.
Is still tired  due to late nights out and work and has to b up early again 2moro 4 work bad times!
This is terribly buggy and you're better off avoiding it; use the website instead, if you're on your mobile device. Latest update doesn't update habit counters on-screen after you press any buttons; all of the command is processed though. App still doesn't display items that are found. Just another buggy update.
Fuck no internet damn time warner!
Not good. Wasted time.
